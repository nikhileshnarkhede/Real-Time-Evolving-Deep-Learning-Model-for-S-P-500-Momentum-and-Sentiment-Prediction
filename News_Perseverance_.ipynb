While initially dismissed as a long shot, reports suggest that CBS-parent company Paramount Global (PARAA, PARA) is now considering a settlement to avoid interference in its merger with Skydance Media. MoffettNathanson senior analyst Robert Fishman joins Market Domination to explain that the challenges in linear TV — particularly with weak advertising and cord-cutting trends by viewers — will force media companies to consolidate. \"Clearly there's complications depending on which asset we're talking about or which company we're talking about. But, at the same time, these companies are going to be forced to go down that direction the more that the pressure builds,\" Fishman says. \"It's going to be the fundamentals that drive the decision, not just the need for consolidation for any other reason.\" Fishman also mentions that while industry fundamentals may drive consolidation, it may also be influenced by the current regulatory stances the Trump administration seems to be displaying.

William Blair industrials research analyst Louie DiPalma joins Market Domination with Julie Hyman and Alexandra Canal to break down why exactly recent headlines are rattling Palantir investors. \"What does the Department of Defense budget and Pete Hegseth and DOGE mean for Palantir? It relates to how approximately 55% of revenue is derived from government customers, and the majority of that government revenue comes from the US government ... [and] within the US government revenue, the vast majority comes from the US Army specifically,\" the analyst outlines. \"There are questions such that, in the new Trump regime, is this program going to start on time, and is there going to be adequate funding?\" DiPalma adds. The analyst highlights the uncertainty about the actual impact of the second Trump administration as conflicting information comes out of the White House. Overall, DiPalma says, \"There seems to be strong support to continue increasing the defense budget, but headlines right now are driving a lot of the market moves.\" Watch the video above to hear why DiPalma is bearish on Palantir despite his bullish outlook for defense spending under Trump 2.0.

Needham & Company managing director Bernie McTernan joins Asking for a Trend to discuss the sports betting platforms that stand to benefit from this big day. McTernan calls the Super Bowl nearly \"the most important day of the year\" for online betting services. He notes that names such as FanDuel — owned by Flutter Entertainment (FLUT) — and DraftKings (DKNG) have ongoing promotions, each adding a $5 million dollar jackpot individuals can buy into to \"get new customers into the system.\" \"What we see over time is that players certainly consolidate their spend,\" he explains to Yahoo Finance, noting that new individuals may use multiple sports betting apps to start but often end up using just one by the end, with FanDuel and DraftKings leading those preferences. \"It's really this flywheel effect where DraftKings and FanDuel, they have the most share. That allows them to invest the most in product and technology, which then drives more share and allows them to invest more,\" he explains to Josh Lipton.
